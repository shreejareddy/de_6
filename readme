User Activity Tracking Pipeline
Overview
This project sets up an AWS-based pipeline to collect, process, and store user activity data.

Components
Data Collection Lambda Function: Uploads user activity data to an S3 bucket.
Data Processing Lambda Function: Processes data from S3 and stores it in DynamoDB.
AWS Step Functions: Orchestrates the Lambda functions for data handling.
DynamoDB Table: Stores processed user activity data.
Setup
Create S3 Bucket: user-activity-data-bucket.
Create DynamoDB Table: UserActivity with user_id (String) and session_id (String).
Deploy Lambda Functions: Upload lambda_function.zip and lambda_processing.zip to AWS Lambda.
Create Step Functions State Machine: Define workflow to run DataCollector and DataProcessor functions.
Usage
Upload data to S3 using the Data Collection Lambda.
Data Processing Lambda will handle data automatically.
Monitor and troubleshoot using CloudWatch.
